This is a site made for my own webcomic.
The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
I will probably create something like a wiki page or a discussion for you guys to 
chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. I hope everyone likes 
the comic.

Also if you want to use this as a base for your own site I would be very happy to explain
if you need help with it.
