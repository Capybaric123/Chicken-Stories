    <h1>Anouncements</h1>
    <p class="anouncement-paragraph">The site was refreshed with some new styles by modifying the <u><i>CSS</i></u> code of the website. Also the site source code was moded which added the oportunity of using <u><i>Markdown</i></u> implementation for the website which means making new pages was made easier by simply using markdown instead of hardcoding the whole page in html. Now, this might seem that it can cause the quality of the website to reduce, but trust me, the site will look way better from this and this also helped with creating the info page as for an example. The website is almost ready for uploading comics, but it will still take some time for the comic to be made since the whole thing is actually made in <u><i>Blender</i></u> and <u><i>Cinema 4D</i></u>. If you are interrested in helping with development of the website, development of the comic, and development of the scripts for new comics, you can follow the page further for the links part and click on the info button located at the site which will lead you to the info page which was actually created using the new markdown implementation. So, what are you waiting for, go check it out!</p>
