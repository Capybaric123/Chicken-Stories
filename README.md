## Stickman-Stories

This is a site made for my own webcomic.
The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
I will probably create something like a wiki page or a discussion for you guys to 
chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. I hope everyone likes 
the comic.

## Software Usage

P.S.
There is a chance that you will need to wait for a while, because the software dev is a bit lazy ;-)
