    <h2>Chicken Stories part-1</h2>
    <p>It's 06:00 am in the morning. The alarm goes off, "What's happening?!" - said oficer Chick - "Anyone here!".
      No one answered, he was terrified, oficer Chick started panicing, what is happening, why is everyone gone, 
      why is the alarm off. Soon after that the hallway fills with a loud "Bang!", he knew that the sound is not 
      the sound of a national rifle. That was enemy! Oficer jumped up swiftly, he picked up his brand new rifle
      which he got not a long time ago from the command. He nervously inserted a full magazine in the gun and co
      cked it carefully, he started walking to the door slowly. He took aim and carefully leaned out of the door 
      way, he caught enemy of guard and the next moment "Bang! Bang! Bang!", the echo of shots and the bullet 
      smashing through the enemy pig's scull. "TAKE THAT MOHTERF..." he couldn't finish his sentence as a tank 
      shell went strait through the wall of the building and detonated in the next room from the oficer, shards 
      of bricks and plaster flew all around the place.
