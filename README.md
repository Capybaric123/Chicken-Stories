# Stickman-Stories

This is a site made for my own webcomic.
The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
I will probably create something like a wiki page or a discussion for you guys to 
chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. I hope everyone likes 
the comic.

## About

The idea of making a webcomic was a thrill for me since the moment I learned coding, there was a bunch of other webcomics I was inspiring of while creating the stickman stories itself, those are: **[Lackadaisy](https://lackadaisy.com/)**

## Software Usage

In case you found this website software interresting and want to use it for your own comics, 
you can access me via email using this adress: dancho321sorokin@gmail.com


P.S.
There is a chance that you will need to wait for a while, because the software dev is a bit lazy ;-)


## Comic Creation

For help see [COMIC-REQUESTS.md](COMIC-REQUESTS)

## Troubleshooting

If you find any issues you can always report them using the [github issues tab](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues) for this project.
Try to explain it as simple as possible because reading through a bunch of issues where you need to read 12 pages to understand what is wrong 
is a bit exausting.

## Wiki

There soon will be a wiki page for this webcomic and there will be posted only checked information (checked by the creator of the comic) and will only contain 
usefull information about the website, of course the actual comic series, and also the cut features secrets and the story of the website creation.

## Discussions

There would be a discussions page for this website coming soon...
