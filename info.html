        # Stickman-Stories

        This is a site made for my own webcomic.
        The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
        I will probably make a discussions page for you guys to 
        chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. 
        I hope everyone likes the comic.

        ## About

        The idea of making a webcomic was a thrill for me since the moment I learned coding, I was always interrested in such things and I had tons of comics and comic pages at home, some of them were just one page long, but some of them were special, if I was interrested in continuing the story for some reason (usually it was because I liked the idea) I'd make an extra page of the comic, and because of that some of my comics were up to **50 pages** because they were so interesting to make. 

        Of course there was a lot more of other things I was inspiring of while creating the stickman stories itself, those are: [Lackadaisy](https://lackadaisy.com/) a very cool webcomic, it gave me the idea of making a website, and [Chicken Gun](https://chicken-gun.fandom.com/wiki/Chicken_Gun_Wiki) a game made by a small developer which became very popular in ru comunity, I was inspired by the fights from there and initially the webcomic idea was to make a comic about chicken gun, but I thought it will be too hard to make it so I finally came up with an idea of creating the stickman stories.

        ## Software Usage

        In case you found this website software interresting and want to use it for your own comics, 
        you can access me via email using this adress: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=dancho321sorokin@gmail.com" target="_blank">dancho321sorokin@gmail.com</a>


        P.S.
        There is a chance that you will need to wait for a while, because the software dev is a bit lazy ;-)

        ## Troubleshooting

        If you find any issues you can always report them using the [github issues tab](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues) for this project.
        Try to explain it as simple as possible because reading through a bunch of issues where you need to read 12 pages to understand what is wrong 
        is a bit exausting.

        ## Wiki

        There soon will be a wiki page for this webcomic and there will be posted only checked information (checked by the creator of the comic) and will only contain 
        usefull information about the website, of course the actual comic series, and also the cut features secrets and the story of the website creation.

        ## Discussions

        There would be a discussions page for this website coming soon...
