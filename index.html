    <h2>Changelog for 06.12.2024</h2>
    <ul type="circle">
        <il><p class="anouncement-paragraph">A new site update just came out and it comes in with the new look for the pages which was created thanks to <i><u>CSS</u></i> and also the site code was modified to sort out the files in to proper folders to make software use easier, also <b>there is a new page</b> called <i>"The Lore Book"</i>, the page will contain (caution breaking news) <b>The Lore</b>, yeah pretty obvious, but anyways, the page is made for people who prefer reading the story in a book format, which also put our <i>Markdown</i> rendering system to the test, it will basically have the same story as the comcis but of course it will be contained in a more of a short way as it will take around 3 pages of the comic to tell one paragraph of a book, so if you for some reason don't enjoy the art of our comic, you can always go and check out the lore book which will contain the same story, but do it at your own risk as it is quite possible that it will have leaks to the new parts of the comic for example the next chapter, so if you don't want to spoil the story for yourself I won't recomend going there, but if you are interrested in the lore and don't want to spend time reading the comics you are welcome. The lore book will also be helpfull for people who are for example making a video about it, as it has more precise information and also it is shortened what means that it is going to perfectly fit in to your script for the video, so good luck youtubers!</p></il>
        <il><p class="anouncement-paragraph">Modified the WIP page. Added a new image without an anoying white background. Changed the contents background colour to a more light one. Added a secret message from the dev for those who are too nosey;).</p></il>
