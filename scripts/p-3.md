The next morning officer Chick woke up from strong wind. "What the hell?" - He mumbled - "Why is the wind so strong". 
He carefully peeked outside the shelter. It was a helicopter, he started panicking "A helicopter!?". The panic increased as the 
rope was slowly being dropped out of the door. A siluette started going down the rope, the view was obstructed by the flying 
sand. The siluette started becoming more visible, it was a chicken! The command heard the radio call he made two days ago, 
it was a miracle. The chicken streched out to reach the officer, the hand of god, the saviour, the hand of help, **brother in the hands**. 
They picked up officer Chick and brought him back to the base, but not the destroyed one it was the site-05, Chicken federation 
had these sites scatered all around the teritory, but site-05 was the biggest of them all. Finally safety, he could calm down.
