        Officer Mikhail was eating treats with his friend when he sudently got a message from the command - Officer Mikhail we need you in your helicopter right now! - Officer was feeling strange, why would they want him right now, it's weekends and also it's winter! He started typing on his phone and then he made a call - This is officer Mikhail, I am on my way to the base, but I'd like to know the reason for this emergency... - The phone answered - There is blufor atacking us on the west border, we already have a few scout drones going around the area, and we already spoted 5 apcs in the area of the Vilongrad... - Oh man, here we go. - Officer jumped in his car and started driving to the millitary base. In an hour he arived, as he was going out of his car a person came up to him and gave him a cup of coffee - Welcome sir! - Said that peson. - Your helicopter is fueld up and ready for flight! The heaters were fixed after the crash because of the lack of oil temperature, also it means you won't need to bring a jacket with you - The man chuckled, like the crash was nothing but a small incident. Officer looked at the man and grunted while walking to his helicopter.
