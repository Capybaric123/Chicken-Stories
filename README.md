This is a site made for my own webcomic.
The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
I will probably create something like a wiki page or a discussion for you guys to 
chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. I hope everyone likes 
the comic.

Also if you want to use this as a base for your own site I would be very happy to explain
if you need help with it.

Here is my email for these cases: dancho321sorokin@gmail.com

If you want to help with creating this webcomic you can also use the same email as for the support to send me your ideas for new parts. Just make sure it is something possible to draw, I think I don't need to explain why... But anyways send your ideas to my email, there is a few more things I want to ask though:

1. File format

   a) It could be either just writen in the mail but it should be short in this case.

   b) It can be any other file format which can be opened and read for example .txt .json .docx .pdf .md

3. Make sure that it is appropriate.
   
   a) no 18+ content (except: guns,some swearing), but still something within the normal range.

   b) no racial discrimination please!

   c) no jokes about specific events (holocaust, 9/11, ww1 and 2), again also within the normal range please.
