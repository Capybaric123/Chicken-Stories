    <h2>Chicken Stories p-1</h2>
    <p>It's 06:00 AM in the morning, Oficer Chick woke up to a alarm, but it wasn't 
    a normal clock alarm... instead it was the facility alarm. He stood up from his 
    bed to grab his radio, but as soon as he did that he heard foorsteps. He quickly 
    grabed his gun nerviously inserted the magazine and trying to be as quiet as possible 
    cocked it.</p>
    <img src="comic_image1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;">
    <p>The footsteps were getting louder as he was walking closer to the doorway. He 
    leaned out and "BANG!". The echo of the bullet going through the enemy pig's skull, 
    but there was no time to celebrate as he still needed to send the message to the 
    command. "Beep!".</p>
    <img src="comic_image2.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
    <p>The radio sounded way louder in a quiet room Oficer hoped no one heard it. "Ugh... 
    this is Oficer Chick, our base was completely destroyed, and I think I am the last survivor 
    I will need to stay low which means I can't use veichles to get to you fast, it will 
    probably take around an hour to get to you, I will take some meds with me incase of 
    friendlys, I think this is it. Out". After he gave himself some time to make the 
    plan Oficer Chick decided to grab his PDA with him to use as a map, "Ugh! The battaries 
    are dying, I guess I'll need to charge it while packing stuff. I hope I don't forget it" 
    and after that he started to put on his vest and pack his tactical backpack.</p>
