    # Lore Book

    This is the lore book for stickman stories, here you will find all of the story without need to read through the comics one by one. This is writen seprately from the comics so there is a chance that there would be leaks of small pices of lore and story before the comic is out so I'd recomend not reading this if you don't want to spoil the whole story to yourself. And if you are still here then you can also check out the wiki at the home page for more secrets and easter eggs, but no, there is no lore in there unless the person responsible for the wiki doesn't start to copy and paste from here ;)

    ## The begining of the war

    The war began rapidly like a wild fire, at first it was just a bunch of blufor and redfor scout drones here and there, but then... <u>*On November 12th 2020 blufor after secretly getting information about the west border*</u> from the scout drones which were constantly getting hit out of the sky and a few people who were ready to sell information about the country to blufor for money, blufor attack squadron 12 made a plan on how to catch the enemy off guard and claim around 20 kilometers of land in one bomb run which will mean that they will also get access to the left over tanks and other millitary equipment produced by the countries in friendly relationship with redfor which for obvious reasons they won't sell to the blufor as then that will count as a betrayal to the redfor and they will start increasing their forces on the countries. But we went off the topic, so let's continue. The blufor 12th attack squadron consisting of two A10Cs and 5 AV8Bs started their jets and filled their weapon racks with cluster bombs, maverics, dummy bombs, and hydra rocket pods moved out. Two hours passed and the 12th attack squadron is already at the border, they started to perform their plan and soon they met the enemy's triple A. One hour in to the battle and there is the first mig-29 coming from the east, you might think that they were helpless in this situation, but in this case you would be very wrong since the AV8B also has the air to air capabilities and even some radar guided weapons, so the mig-29 wasn't a big deal. By the next day the mission was acomplished and blufor had no losses, unlike redfor which 3 mig-29s were killed in action, they were rewarded with the purple heart medal.
