# Comic Requests

If you want to help with creating this webcomic you can also use this email: dancho321sorokin@gmail.com as for the support to send me your ideas for new parts. Just make sure it is something possible to draw, I think I don't need to explain why... But anyways send your ideas to my email, there is a few more things I want to ask though:

## 1. File format

   a) It could be either just writen in the mail but it should be short in this case.

   b) It can be any other file format which can be opened and read for example .txt .json .docx .pdf .md

## 2. Make sure that it is appropriate.

   a) no 18+ content (except: guns,some swearing), but still something within the normal range.

   b) no racial discrimination please!

   c) no jokes about specific events (holocaust, 9/11, ww1 and 2), again also within the normal range please.

## 3. Images

   a) You can send me a whole ilustration too, but it needs to be in one of these formats: .png .jpg .jpeg .webp

   b) You can't send me files with these formats: .psd .sai .kra .fla .tff .pdf .bmp .ai .svg .eps
