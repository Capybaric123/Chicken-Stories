                Welcome to **Stickman-Stories**, my personal webcomic project! This site is dedicated to sharing the adventures and tales of stickman characters through the medium of digital comics. It is a work of passion that has evolved over time, combining my love for comics with my journey in web development. I hope you enjoy the stories as much as I enjoy creating them!
                
                The site itself is built using HTML and CSS, with a dash of JavaScript to make it interactive. While the JavaScript involved is relatively simple, it serves the purpose of enhancing the user experience. A special shout-out goes to the creators of **md-block**, which has been an incredible tool for creating this site, and **Jekyll**, the static site generator that powers both the website and the webcomic code.
                
                As the community grows, I plan to introduce a discussions page, where fans and readers can engage, share feedback, and suggest new ideas for future comic strips. I hope this helps cultivate an interactive space for everyone involved!
                
                I hope you enjoy the comic and feel free to contribute your ideas. It's all about building a creative space where we can all share and explore new ideas.

                # About
                
                The idea of creating a webcomic has been an exciting endeavor for me ever since I learned to code. Comics have always fascinated me, and I've had an extensive collection at home. Some of these comics were short one-page stories, while others were extensive multi-page epics. There was always a sense of satisfaction in creating more when I felt inspired. In fact, I’ve made a few comics that reached up to **50 pages** because I couldn’t stop exploring the ideas that I loved.
                
                One of the major inspirations behind **Stickman-Stories** was my love for storytelling and creative expression. While I initially envisioned a comic based on the game **Chicken Gun** (a game developed by a small studio that gained a significant following in the Russian community), I realized that creating a comic about the game’s characters and universe would be challenging. Instead, I decided to go with the concept of stick figures, which allowed for a more flexible and fun approach to storytelling.
                
                In addition to **Chicken Gun**, another major influence on the comic’s development was the webcomic **Lackadaisy**. Its rich storytelling, incredible artwork, and the idea of creating a professional webcomic really resonated with me. **Lackadaisy** inspired me to design my own website for **Stickman-Stories** and focus on bringing the same level of quality to my own work.
