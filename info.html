        # Stickman-Stories

        This is a site made for my own webcomic.
        The site is made using HTML and CSS. While there is JavaScript it's very simple.
        Also special thanks to the developers of md-block as it helps creating web pages and also to jekyll as it is the software used to build this website and also the webcomic code.
        I will probably make a discussions page for you guys to 
        chat in there and give me ideas for new parts of the comic. 
        I hope everyone likes the comic.

        ## About

        The idea of making a webcomic was a thrill for me since the moment I learned coding, I was always interrested in such things and I had tons of comics and comic pages at home, some of them were just one page long, but some of them were special, if I was interrested in continuing the story for some reason (usually it was because I liked the idea) I'd make an extra page of the comic, and because of that some of my comics were up to **50 pages** because they were so interesting to make. 

        Of course there was a lot more of other things I was inspiring of while creating the stickman stories itself, those are: [Lackadaisy](https://lackadaisy.com/) a very cool webcomic, it gave me the idea of making a website, and [Chicken Gun](https://chicken-gun.fandom.com/wiki/Chicken_Gun_Wiki) a game made by a small developer which became very popular in ru comunity, I was inspired by the fights from there and initially the webcomic idea was to make a comic about chicken gun, but I thought it will be too hard to make it so I finally came up with an idea of creating the stickman stories.

        ## Software Usage

        In case you found this website software interresting and want to use it for your own comics, 
        you can access me via email using this adress: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=dancho321sorokin@gmail.com" target="_blank">dancho321sorokin@gmail.com</a>


        P.S.
        There is a chance that you will need to wait for a while, because the software dev is a bit lazy ;-)

        ## Troubleshooting

        If you find any issues you can always report them using the [github issues tab](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Stickman-Stories/issues) for this project.
        Try to explain it as simple as possible because reading through a bunch of issues where you need to read 12 pages to understand what is wrong 
        is a bit exausting.

        ## Wiki

        There is a wiki page for this comic made by the comic author what means that it will contain only actual information from the comic and also will be checked and moderated for any bugs or issues which can cause misunderstanding. So go check it out right now or else there is a chance that you will not understand what is this whole thing about as there is a lot of explanation to stuff in the comic as well as the lore book which you can find at the main or home page.

        ## Discussions

        There would be a discussions page for this website coming soon...
